# string-expressions-calculator

This calculator is pretty ugly, I did not finish it yet ^.^

My bracketsRemover work only with one operator inside :(
In one day, I will have time to repair it!

But it has an interesting logic! I want to make it work without using nashorn or javascript, just working with substrings and conversion from string to numbers.
